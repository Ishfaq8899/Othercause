\usage{
get_other_cause_mortality(cdc_data, MCED_cdc, hmd_data, selected_cancers)

get_other_cause_mortality(cdc_data, MCED_cdc, hmd_data, selected_cancers)
}
\arguments{
\item{cdc_data}{A data frame with all-cause mortality data from the CDC. This data frame should
include columns: "Single-Year Ages Code", "Gender", "Year", "Deaths", "Population", "Crude Rate".}

\item{MCED_cdc}{A data frame with cancer-specific mortality data from the CDC. This data frame should
include columns: "Single-Year Ages Code", "Sex", "Year", "ICD-10 113 Cause List",
"ICD-10 113 Cause List Code", "Deaths", "Population", "Crude Rate".}

\item{hmd_data}{A data frame with population data from HMD. This data frame should include columns:
"Year", "Age", "Female", "Male", "Total".}

\item{selected_cancers}{A character vector specifying the cancer types to analyze.
These names include: "Bladder","Breast","Colorectal", "Esophagus","Gastric", "Headandneck",
"Liver", "Lung","Ovary", "Pancreas", "Prostate", "Renal", "Uterine"}

\item{all_cause_data}{A data frame containing all-cause mortality data with
columns: Notes, Age, Gender, Year, Deaths, Population, all_crude_Rate.}

\item{MCED_cause_data}{A data frame containing MCED cancer-specific mortality
data with columns: Year, Age, Gender, cancer_site, Deaths, Population.}
}
\value{
A data frame with other-cause death rates containing columns:
  age, sex, year, other_cause_rate.

A data frame with age-specific and sex-specific mortality rates due to causes
        other than the selected cancers. Includes columns: age, sex, year, other_cause_rate.
}
\description{
This function calculates mortality rates for causes other than the selected (MCED) cancers.

This function calculates mortality rates for causes other than the selected (MCED) cancers.
All cause and cause-specific (MCED) death rates for 2018-2022 were obtained from CDC (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention 2025) and HMD (Human Mortality Database 2025) by age and gender.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\itemize{
  \item Filters MCED cancer data for selected cancer sites
  \item Converts all cause and MCED cancer-specific central death rates to probabilities using the formula
        of Rosenberg (2006)
  \item Calculates other-cause death probability as the difference
  \item Convert other cause death probabilities to rates using inverse formula of Rosenberg (2006).
}

The function performs several steps:

1. Filters the MCED cancer data for the selected cancers.
2. Converts HMD data to a long format for easier processing.
3. Process all cause CDC and HMD data to generate all cause death rates
4. Convert all-cause death rates to probabilities using formula of Rosenberg (2006).
5. Process MCED CDC and HMD cancer data to generate MCED cancer death rates
6. Convert MCED cancer death rates to probabilities using formula of Rosenberg (2006).
7. Compute probability of death from causes other than MCED cancers
8. Convert other cause death probabilities to rates using inverse formula of Rosenberg (2006).
